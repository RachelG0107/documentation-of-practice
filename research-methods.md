This is not particularly an image, but a screenshot that I toke. I found this in the WeChat website, and it is an explanation regarding users’ concerns about their privacy. I have been research about WeChat’s chats privacy issue, and found a report saying that a Dutch researcher Gevers found “a Chinese database storing more than 1 billion WeChat conversations, including more than 3.7 billion messages, and tweeted out his findings. Each message had been tagged with a GPS location, and many included users’ national identification numbers. “ (https://www.npr.org/2019/08/29/751116338/china-intercepts-wechat-texts-from-u-s-and-abroad-researcher-says) And I notice that in recent years WeChat has been asking their users to provide real ID numbers du to government requirement and policies. In such case, it is not just about chats’ histories but also users’ personal information.

I also have looked about the censorship issue. I found an article not on WeChat but another Chinese social media (Weibo) that listed some past articles that were posted in WeChat and were censored down. There were some common topics including sexuality, the LGBTQ community, sensitive political topics…
